        <h1>About My Favourite hobby<br>Playing Football</h1>
        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>

        <h1>My Favourite hobby</h1>
        <p>My favourite hobby is playing football and many more games! But my most favourite hobby is playing football. In football I enjoy the moments when someone does a goal. When I play it I'm the stricker to help my fellow teamates in winning the match but I am not a pro at it sometimes we win and other times we lose but we have fun!</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <p>I'm inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo. He plays football and my main thing for my inspiration was that footballers have so much pain to fight against others to make a single goal. I see the blood leaking from Ronaldo and then got the Inspiration. The inspiration is that footballers come across very painful situation but still fight and this openned my eyes. I thaught that let's play in the future to continue the respect to footballers.</p>
